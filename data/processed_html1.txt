- MD TOUFIQUE MD TOUFIQUE • You You Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast || Building AI Solutions for business Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast || Building AI Solutions for business 4mo • 4 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn Missed calls are silent killers for local businesses. I asked a local plumber how he handles them. He said: "By the time I call them back, they've already found someone else." That line hit me hard. Because it’s not just a missed call. It’s a missed job. A missed customer. And a missed paycheck. So I built something to fix it. A dead-simple automation using → n8n + Vapi AI. Here’s how it works: → A customer calls your business number → Vapi AI picks up and talks to them like a real person → It asks for their name, what they need, and when they’re free → n8n takes that info and instantly books it in your calendar → Then it sends a confirmation text or email No voicemails. No chasing callbacks. No juggling schedules. It just works. And it saves hours every week. More importantly— It stops the revenue leak most businesses don’t even notice. If you're running or helping a service business, this kind of automation is a no-brainer. Watch the 2-minute demo. Then go build it or message me and I’ll show you how. Follow Genaus for more real-world automations that make you money while you work. …more 2

Built a Medical Chatbot using Python, Flask, and GPT. It answers health-related questions, helps users understand symptoms, and even tells them when to see a real doctor. The goal was simple: → Make health info more accessible → Build something functional with AI → Learn by actually doing the work The full project is open-source and live here: https://lnkd.in/dGV56R4k Big thanks to Boktiar Ahmed Bappy for creating the course that guided this entire build. Clear, practical, and packed with real-world value. If you want to learn AI development that actually teaches you how to ship a project, this is it. Appreciate the knowledge, shared by DSwithBappy. …more 2
